"""
MEOK LAW MCP Server
===================
Region-aware AI governance for ANY agent, humanoid, robotics company, or business — built on
the real CSOAI crosswalks (12 frameworks, CSOAI's 52-article Partnership Charter as the hub).

Connect from your own stack and get three honest answers:
  • which rules apply to you, here          (law_applicable)
  • what changes when an agent crosses a border  (law_crosswalk — the cross-region handoff)
  • a portable "AI social contract" + cert   (law_social_contract / law_register)

Informational governance mapping, NOT legal advice. The authoritative, SIGIL-hash-chained
registration lives at https://meok.ai/law — this MCP issues self-attested certificates.
